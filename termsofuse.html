                    <p>For example – If you have Rs.100 bonus and you play a deals Poker game of Rs. 200, 10% of Rs.200, i.e., Rs.20 bonus, would be credited to your withdrawal balance once the game is completed. If you play the next game of Rs.500, then 10% of Rs.500, i.e., Rs.50 bonus, would be credited to your withdrawal balance. It will continue till the whole bonus amount is released. The release percentage/rate may vary depending on the offer.</p>

                    <p>Our random number generator (RNG) has been verified by iTech Labs, a globally competent authority (ISO 17025 certified) for RNG verification and provides RNG certifications to gaming companies globally. The RNG uses an algorithm to generate random numbers, ensuring that all players get cards selected randomly from a well-shuffled deck and are dealt fairly by the system without any bias. The shuffling tests were conducted on large enough samples to give the calculations sufficient. As a result, iTech Labs has found that the card sequences are unpredictable, non-repeatable, and uniformly distributed.
